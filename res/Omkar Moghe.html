        <div id="about">
            <p>I am an aspiring developer who is passionate about Android development. Some of the work I have done includes Spudy, an app that extracts text from pictures and speed reads it back to the user, and the official MHacks Android app for MHacks V which was used by over 500 people. I am proficient in Android, Java, and I am currently learning C++. I also have experience with Parse, a mobile backend platform. <br><br>
            Out side of the classroom, I am heavily involved in hackathons. I am an active member of the MHacks Core Team and help run tech as well as Android mentorship during the event. Recently, I led a small lecture on Android game development. <br><br>
            I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge in both mobile development and programming in general.
