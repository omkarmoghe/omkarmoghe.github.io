[Pokémap](http://pokemapgo.xyz/) was a project I built during the peak of the Pokémon Go hype in the summer of 2016. It started with a Reddit post where someone had reverse engineered the Pokémon Go API in Javascript.

At the time I was pretty involved in Android development, and decided to create an Android app using the API which someone had ported to Java. The idea was simple &mdash; create a simple app to display nearby Pokémon. In order to use the API you needed a valid token, or in other words, you needed to pretend like you were a legitimate Pokémon Go client.

## Obtaining the API Key

Obtaining an API key was the first challenge.

At this point, Pokémap was truly alive. I created the repo and pushed the basic Android app with virtually no user interface, but a working "login" that effectively pretended to be just another Pokémon Go client.
