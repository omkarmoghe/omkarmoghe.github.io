- Bank integrations (US + int'l)
- Payment "rail" or network integrations
  - US rails (ACH, wire, RTP, FedNow, checks)
  - Int'l rails (cross-border ACH, EFT, SEPA, etc.)
- Foreign exchange (rate, quotes, contracts)
- Cryptocurrency and stablecoins (on-ramp, payouts, bridging)
- Payment service provider (PSP)
- Double entry accounting/ledgering systems
- Virtual accounts, wallets
- Payment origination at scale
- Receivables at scale
