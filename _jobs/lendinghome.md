I worked on the same team throughout my time at [LendingHome](https://www.lendinghome.com/) which served many different internal "Ops" teams, and our institutional and retail Investors. Ultimately we were simply known as the "Money" Team, as we owned the most, if not all our systems that moved money. I worked heavily on servicing, payment, and money movement systems that moved large volumes daily.

Some of the systems/things I worked on, in no particular order:

- Money movement infrastructure
- Banking integrations
- [Loan servicing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan_servicing.asp) payment infrastructure
- [Retail investor](https://www.lendinghome.com/users/sign-up/investor) marketplace & products
- Institutional investor portals & products
- Loan [securitizations](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Securitization)
- Summer intern program (outreach, interviewing, hiring, coordinating)
- Decomposing a [monolith](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Monolithic_application) into [services](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Service-oriented_architecture)
- Authorization service (early stages)
- Mario Kart Tour (team bonding)

And some languages/tools I used:

- Ruby, Rails
- JavaScript, React
- PostgreSQL
- AWS (S3, EC2, SNS, SQS)
- Splunk, Sentry
