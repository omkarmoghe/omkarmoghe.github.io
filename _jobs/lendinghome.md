I worked on the same team throughout my time at LendingHome which served many different internal "Ops" teams, and our institutional and retail Investors. Ultimately we were known simply as the "Money" Team, as we owned the most, if not all our systems that moved money. I worked heavily on servicing, payment, and money movement systems that moved large volumes daily.

Some of the systems/things I worked on, in no particular order:

- Bank integrations & money movement service
- [Loan servicing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan_servicing.asp) payment infrastructure
- [Retail investor marketplace & products](https://www.lendinghome.com/users/sign-up/investor)
- Institutional investor portals & products
- Summer intern program (outreach, interviewing, hiring)
- Decomposing a [monolith](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Monolithic_application) into [services](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Service-oriented_architecture)
- Authorization service
