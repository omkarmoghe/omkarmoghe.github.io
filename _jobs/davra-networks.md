My internship at [Davra Networks](https://davra.com/) during the summer after my freshman year of college was my first software focused job. Davra's IoT platform encompasses many things (pun intended), but at the time we were focused on connected vehicles and fleet management.

I designed and developed an Android table application meant to sit inside vehicles for drivers to use to connect and interact with the Davra platform. The application provided navigation, displayed information from the vehicle's [OBD system](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/On-board_diagnostics) via the IoT platform, as well as messaging between fleet managers and drivers.

Outside of coding, I got to represent Darvra at various conferences and expos that summer including Cisco Live in San Diego and IoT World in San Francisco.
