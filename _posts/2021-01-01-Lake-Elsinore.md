To start the new year, my girlfriend and I spent two weeks in an AirBnB in Lake Elsinore. We were lucky to get some solid warm weather and found a nice little beach to catch some gorgeous sunsets. The mountains next to the lake were a perfect backdrop as well. Here are some of my favorites from the trip. All of these were shot on a 35mm prime and are unedited.

One of the nights, we drove a couple hours out to a village with low light pollution to attempt some night sky photography. I found out on the way back that my focus was off, and the stars ended up looking a _bit_ larger than they should.

Got a few star trails on this one.
