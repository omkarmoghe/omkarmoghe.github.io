I turned 25 earlier this spring and bought my first car. I wanted something I could modify and mess with so I picked up a 10th gen Civic Hatch (FK7).

I've mostly been making aesthetic upgrades, but this past July 4th weekend, I got some time to work on my first performance mod. Swapped the rear sway bar with a stiffer 22mm kit. Took about 2 hours &mdash; shout out to my buddy for helping out.

Getting it back in took a bit more sweat.

Mod's not complete without the sticker.
