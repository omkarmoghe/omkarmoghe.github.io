Over Thanksgiving this past month, I was able to see a few old friends from my hometown. One of my buddies asked me if I wanted to tag along with him to the track. I said yes. He said we'd have to leave early and drive a couple hours up I-5 to the track. I said okay.

We left around 5 AM and got to Turnhill shortly after the sunrise. Here are a few of my favorite pics from our day at the track. Shout out to [Turn8](https://www.turn8racing.com/) for hosting the event.

Our ride for the day &mdash; my buddy's A4.

Cool custom build &mdash; my friend mentioned it sounded like a Miata engine.

Only other Audi happened to be a R8.

Loved the lighting on these last two, especially this Corvette.

I still gotta upload the GoPro footage for the 2mi runs...
