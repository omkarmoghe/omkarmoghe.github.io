In October, my dad and I built a pair of speakers our of foam board. He's a bit of an audiophile and loves working on hardware projects, so we decided to follow a mini [_Karlsonator_](https://www.google.com/search?q=karlsonator) build we found on DIY Audio. The exact guide we used is the 0.40 Single TC9FD version, which is somewhere deep in [this thread](https://www.diyaudio.com/forums/full-range/239338-mini-karlsonator-0-53x-dual-tc9fds.html) (DIY Audio) for the 0.53 Dual TC9FD version.

The speakers pack a punch and the bass was noticeably deeper when we added the front panel. Here are some pictures from the build!

Here's the speaker &mdash; the [TC9FD full range woofer](https://www.parts-express.com/peerless-by-tymphany-tc9fd18-08-3-1-2-full-range-paper-cone-woofer--264-1062).

Gluing the internal "horn" to the side panel.

We deviated from the build guide slightly here and added the tiny support pieces that hold the internal folds in shape on both side panels. This made glueing the last side panel a bit challenging but gave the enclosures some more stability.

Finally we mounted the speakers and top/back piece. Using some laptops as weights for the glue. The two black front plates were the last step.
