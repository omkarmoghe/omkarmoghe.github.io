# Omkar Moghe

Welcome! I'm a software engineer currently based in San Francisco. I studied Computer Science and Engineering at <span class="umich"><a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/">The University of Michigan</a></span>. I love sandwiches, traveling, the 49ers, and hip-hop, sometimes at the same time. Feel free to poke around to see what I'm up to and get in touch.
