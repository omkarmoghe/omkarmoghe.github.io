# Omkar Moghe

Yo! I'm a software engineer currently based in <span class="san_francisco">S</span>an <span class="san_francisco">F</span>rancisco. I studied Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/">The University of <span class="umich">M</span>ichigan</a>. I love sandwiches, traveling, the <span class="sf_49ers">49</span>ers, hip-hop, and cars &mdash; sometimes at the same time. Feel free to poke around to see what I'm up to and get in [touch](/links).
