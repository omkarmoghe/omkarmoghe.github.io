Yo! I'm a software engineer from the <span class="sf_giants glow">S</span>an <span class="sf_giants glow">F</span>rancisco Bay Area, currently based in <span class="los_angeles glow">L</span>os <span class="los_angeles glow">A</span>ngeles. I studied Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/">The University of <span class="umich glow">M</span>ichigan</a>. I love sandwiches, exploring new cities, the <span class="sf_49ers glow">49</span>ers, hip-hop, and modding my car &mdash; sometimes at the same time. Feel free to poke around to see what I'm up to and get in [touch](https://x.com/omkvr). 🤙🏽
